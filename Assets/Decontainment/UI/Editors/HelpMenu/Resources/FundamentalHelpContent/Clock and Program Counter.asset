    text: Each bot has a timer called a clock that waits for 20 milliseconds then
      resets. Every time it resets, it triggers a clock tick. One instruction is executed
      per clock tick. Keep the 20-millisecond interval in mind when designing your
      programs. Longer sections of code will take longer to execute.

    text: Each bot has a number called a program counter that keeps track of which
      line of the program is next to execute. The PC moves every clock tick, and increments
      by one by default. This is what causes instructions to execute one after another.
      When the PC reaches the end of a program, it loops back to the beginning. Branch
      instructions can override the default behavior if a condition is met and force
      the PC to jump to a specific line in the program.
