    text: "An instruction is a single command given to a bot. Each instruction has
      a set of parameters that affect its execution. For example, the parameters for
      the ADD instruction are the register you want to store the result in and the
      two values you want to add together.\r\n\r\nA program consists of a sequence
      of instructions and a collection of labels. Instructions in a program are executed
      one at a time.\r\n\r\nTo add an instruction to a program, drag the instruction
      from the code bench to the part of the program you want to insert it at. A white
      line will appear to indicate where the instruction will be inserted. To move
      an instruction, drag it from its current place in the program and place it just
      as you would a new instruction.\r"
