    text: A subroutine is a section of code that can be used in multiple parts of
      a program. They require a branch label at the beginning and an RSR (return from
      subroutine) instruction at the end. Start a subroutine with the CSR (call subroutine)
      instruction and provide the corresponding branch label as a parameter. This
      will save the current PC onto a stack and jump to the branch label. Calling
      RSR pulls the last saved PC from the stack and restores it, jumping to the instruction
      after CSR.
